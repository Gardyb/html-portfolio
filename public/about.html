<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello sir/ma'am, I appreciate you for taking the time to read my profile. Moreover, just to give you some context about myself, my name is Gardy Beauicaut.
  I am originally form New York City, where it has been said on several occasions that the city never sleeps. I have been living in the sate of Florida since 2008. 
  And have lived in Florida for 17 yrs. I felt the conviction to want to pursue a web development career at the end of 2024, for the fact that 
  the internet is always active and never sleeps. Ultimaely, I appreciate the fact that websites provide alot of context about the personal impact, that a business 
  can make in a community. Since living in a digital era the most effective way to reach multple consumers all at once, is through online resources such as: QR-codes, websites, hyper links, etc.
  I am truly convinced that the internet is here to stay and so is Web Development!
